# SunLock Lab Solar Stewart Tracker

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/logo.jpeg" alt="System Overview" width="750">
</p>

Real-time embedded C++17 software for solar tracking using a **3-RRS Stewart-type parallel mechanism** on **Raspberry Pi / Linux**.

This project implements an event-driven pipeline in which camera frames are delivered through callbacks, processed by vision and control modules, converted into platform motion through inverse kinematics, and safely applied to three actuators through a hardware abstraction layer. The architecture is designed to follow the course expectations for **blocking I/O**, **callback-based communication**, **multi-threaded processing**, **bounded latency**, **modular structure**, and **CMake-based reproducibility**.

## Project Overview
The **Solar Stewart Tracker** is a Linux userspace realtime embedded system that:

- acquires camera frames from a camera backend
- detects the sun position using image processing
- computes tracking corrections
- converts desired motion into **3RRS inverse kinematics**
- applies safety shaping before actuation
- drives three servo outputs through a PCA9685 PWM controller

The design goal is not only functional tracking, but tracking implemented in a way that is:

- **event-driven**
- **responsive**
- **modular**
- **testable**
- **reproducible**
- **safe for hardware control**

The main realtime software path is:

**Camera -> SunTracker -> Controller -> Kinematics3RRS -> ActuatorManager -> ServoDriver**

---

## Key Features

## System Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/Threaded Event-Driven System Architecture Diagram" alt="System Architecture" width="900">
</p>

The repository is organised around a staged runtime pipeline.

### Core modules

- **ICamera**  
  Abstract camera interface used by the system.

- **LibcameraPublisher**  
  Raspberry Pi / Linux camera backend when `libcamera` is available.

- **SimulatedPublisher**  
  Fallback or simulation camera backend.

- **SystemManager**  
  Top-level orchestrator for state, queues, callbacks, and worker threads.

- **SunTracker**  
  Vision module that finds the bright target and estimates sun position.

- **Controller**  
  Converts tracking error into platform tilt/pan setpoints.

- **Kinematics3RRS**  
  Converts platform setpoints into actuator-space commands.

- **ActuatorManager**  
  Safety shaping layer for command limiting.

- **ServoDriver**  
  Final actuator output layer.

- **LatencyMonitor**  
  Measures timing across the userspace pipeline.

### Threading model

The runtime design uses separate responsibilities with blocking waits:

- **camera/backend context**: frame acquisition and callback delivery
- **control thread**: vision, control, and kinematics
- **actuator thread**: safety filtering and output application
- **main/event loop**: application lifecycle and optional UI/event handling

### Queue policy

Inter-stage communication uses bounded queues with a **freshest-data** policy:

- frame queue capacity: **1**
- command queue capacity: **1**

This avoids stale backlog and prioritises current data over historical frames.

## Circuit Diagram

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/circuit_diagram.png" alt="Circuit Diagram" width="900">
</p>

The hardware setup connects:

* camera through a libcamera-compatible interface
* PCA9685 PWM driver over I2C
* three servo motors
* Raspberry Pi acting as the central controller

The PCA9685 generates stable PWM signals for the servos, while I2C provides communication between the Raspberry Pi and the actuator driver layer.

cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Build:

```bash
cmake --build build -j
```

## Running

### Core CLI application

Linux:

```bash
./build/solar_tracker
```

Typical Windows location:

```powershell
build\Release\solar_tracker.exe
```

### Software-only mode

The software-only path uses a simulated camera backend and a non-hardware actuator path for development and testing without the physical platform.

### Optional Qt GUI application

Built only when Qt5 is found:

```bash
./build/solar_tracker_qt
```

Typical Windows location:

```powershell
build\Release\solar_tracker_qt.exe
```

### Hardware mode

Hardware execution requires:

* libcamera support
* I2C enabled on the host
* PCA9685 connected correctly
* servo power and wiring connected correctly

The system will enter **FAULT** if required hardware is unavailable or startup fails.

### Manual hardware smoke test

```bash
./build/tests/servo_manual_smoketest
```

---

## Realtime Evidence

The measured software-side userspace pipeline is:

**Camera -> SunTracker -> Controller -> Kinematics3RRS -> ActuatorManager -> ServoDriver**

All measurements are taken using monotonic timestamps recorded inside the software pipeline.

### Latency Results

| Metric      | Average (ms) | Minimum (ms) | Maximum (ms) | Jitter (ms) |
| ----------- | -----------: | -----------: | -----------: | ----------: |
| **L_total** |    **0.800** |        0.636 |        3.806 |       3.171 |
| L_vision    |        0.795 |        0.631 |        3.803 |           — |
| L_control   |        0.004 |        0.001 |        1.252 |           — |
| L_actuation |        0.001 |       0.0006 |        0.005 |           — |

Interpretation:

* average end-to-end software latency is below **1 ms**
* worst-case measured software latency is below **4 ms**
* observed jitter is below **4 ms**
* measurements represent the **userspace software path only**, not hard real-time guarantees or full mechanical settling time
